This is particularly important if you are in the habit of setting unrealistic goals and abandoning them when you make the smallest mistake. We can avoid this by making sure that your goals are SMART: Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, Time-bound.  For example, instead of \"stop binge eating today\", SMART goals would be to \"start by establishing a regular breakfast\", \"begin reintroducing bread in my diet\".  Some of your goals may be related to your eating but not necessarily about your binging behaviours e.g. \"swim at the beach in my swimming costume\".  N.B. Be careful not to set goals that maintain your body image concerns and your eating disorder  should e.g. \"lose 10kg\", \"look better in a bikini\", \"stick to my diet\"."
